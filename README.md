### Ue4duino ###
UE4duino is a plugin in Unreal Engine 4 that allows communication
with Arduino. It comes with events such as Serial Open, Serial Read, Serial Write,
etc. Such serial events allow transmission and reception of data from and to the
Arduino. In this project, this is used to receiver the sensor data from the Arduino and
send the actuation data back to it. The plugin is added to the Unreal Engine 4
environment as a ZIP library. Then it could be accessed from the Blueprint of any
object on the level. The events from the level are used to trigger serial events.

### Communication Interface ### 
The serial communication module is used by UE4 for
communicating with Arduino. The sensor reading is read by Arduino, which in turn
sent to unreal engine 4 by serial communication module. The readings are used for
rendering the same hand motion on the screen. The serial communication is the
process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over
a communication channel or computer bus. The reading from several sensors at a
time to the UE4 serially.

### Enabling orientation for the arm ### 
The orientation sensor is attached to the arm
which tracks the motion of the arm and send the co-ordinates to the unreal engine
serially. The 3rd person characterâ€™s arm on screen is modified accordingly to the
values received. The arm on the screen moves accordingly to the arm in the real
world. The orientation is fed to the IK kinetics module to render it on the screen.

### Mapping between arm and software ### 
The values from sensors is transferred
serially to the unreal engine. The value is transferred as a string to the SERIAL IN
module. The string is split into separate values and is fed to BONE ROTATION
module. The bone rotation module is used for to rotating the hand, according to the
real hand motion. The bone module will feed the values to the separate finger
modules necessary for the hand and finger rotation.

### Contact detection ### 
The collision detection module is used to detect the collision
between hand and object. The collision is required to actuate the button vibrators
which will be responsible for the sense of touch. The actuator output will be sent
through the SERIAL OUT module to the Arduino. Arduino will activate the
respective actuators. The actuators will give the sense of touch as to the object
touched on the screen.

### Synchronization ###
In parallel, all the sensor data is continuously fed to the UE4. The synchronization
is very much required for the perfect collision detection and actuator activation. The
proper synchronization between the arm and fingers is necessary to understand the
gesture of the hand. The proper synchronization is needed between the virtual and
real world for the proper actuation and sense of touch. The synchronization is done
using modules in Arduino. The serial in module reads data simultaneously from all
the sensors and is properly synchronized for reaching out to the deliverables.
